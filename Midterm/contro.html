	<h1> The Controversy Surrounding the SHSAT </h1>

	<section>

		<h4> First, Why do so many students take the SHSAT? </h4>

		<p> Simple, the Specialized High Schools are seen as an opportunity to get further. These high schools have amazing academic records, while being free to attend. It's a well known fact that most alumni from these schools go to elite colleges and have prestigious careers. On top of that, these schools usually receive higher funding. </p>

		<p> Thus, many students try their best to score as high as possible on the SHSAT, since it is the only way to get accepted into the schools. It is supposed to be a "fair" way to accept students.</p>

		<h4> Yet, Why do Statistics Show that the Test isn't Fair? </h4>

		<p> As shown from the pie charts before, there is a big dispartity between who takes the test and who receive an offer. For example, although from the test takers almost half of them identify as Latino or Black, only 11% of the offers go to Latino or Black people. </p>

		<p> Although these charts show the information for 2019, this issue of only a few seats going to people of the Latino or Black community has been ongoing for years now. </p>

		<p> This data points that the test is an unfair way to accept students into these Specialized High Schools. </p>

		<p> As a result, NYC Mayor Bill Deblasio has been pushing an initative to get rid of the SHSAT. He says that 67% of NYC public schools population is that of Latino and Black students so why is only 10% represented in these schools? </p>

		<p> However, there is a backlash from White and Asian families as any new admissions methods would mean a lot less of them will be getting accepted into these 'prestigious' schools. </p>

		<h4> What are some factors that are upspoken of? </h4>
		
		<p> First of all, TEST PREP! A lot of students who get accepted into these high schools go through test prep as their families can afford it. Now, this is an issue because the test is supposed to be fair in a way that the student's economical background should not matter. </p>

		<p> Then, there is a lack of teaching about the SHSAT in public middle schools. The SHSAT is more similar to the SAT rather than a normal middle school exam. How are students who are not taught this material in school supposed to do well on it? Why aren't teachers in 7th grade explaining how its a hard exam and you should study beforehand? </p>

		<p> These are only some of the issues with the system. The next page will continue to list the pros and cons of the test and the system itself. </p>
