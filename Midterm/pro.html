    		<h3>Pro</h3>
    		<h3>* Test is merit-based, and therefore, 'supposed' to be fair. </h3>
    		<h3>* Test is supposed to give an opportunity to students from any background and any wealth status. </h3>
    		<h3>* The test helps have a consistent measure of 'intelligence' across the city's different middle schools. </h3>
    		<h3>* Students who are not in top middle schools can get into a good highschool still. </h3>
    		<h3>* Students who are not top students in their own schools are able to get into a good highschool. </h3>
    		<h3>* The test creates groups of 'smart' students together to go through high school challenges with. </h3>
    		<h3>* The students accepted are supposed to be able to go through rigorous courses. </h3>

    		<h2>Con</h2>
    		<h2>* Test Prep takes away the fairness, because not everyone can afford it. </h2>
    		<h2>* Not enough students are taught about the SHSAT in their schools. </h2>
    		<h2>* Test results are favoring certain races over others. </h2>
    		<h2>* The test is unfair to those students, who may have testing anxiety or are different types of learners in general.</h2>
    		<h2>* Test requires a lot of studying on top of student's normal schoolwork.</h2>
    		<h2>* Test will allow students who are good at standardized testing to get accepted regardless of whether that student is a good student or not, which may lead to that student doing poorly in high school.</h2>
