	<h1> An Overview of the College Education in America </h1>
	<h3> The Promise </h3>
	<h2> Many students go to college with the promise that it will help them land a better job than those who do not obtain a college degree. </h2>

	<h3> The Cost </h3>
	<h2> College is so expensive, that many students and their families will go into debt. </h2>

	<h3> The Result </h3>
	<h2> Although, many students every year make the decision to enroll in the higher education system, the value of a college degree is actually going down. This is because there is a growing number of jobs that don't require a degree.</h2>
