	<h1> The American College System </h1>

	<h3> College is Stressful </h3>

	<h2> Although, college can be depicted in movies as "the best time in your life," I would say that college is quite stressful especially in current times. </h2>

	<h2> We have a lot on our plate as college students, especially because right now we are in the middle of a pandemic. </h2>

	<h2> I am sure some of us are worried about finding a job after graduation, since things are very uncertain right now. </h2>

	<h4> Some of us need a job right after college because we have loans to pay off! </h4>

	<h3> This website will discuss the American College System, it's flaws, and explain why time management is such an important skill for college students. </h3>
