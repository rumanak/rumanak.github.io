	<h1> The Flaws in the American College System </h1>

	<h3> College is Stressful </h3>

        <h2> Although, college can be depicted in movies as "the best time in your life," I would say that college is quite stressful especially in current times. </h2>

        <h2> We have a lot on our plate as college students, especially because right now we are in the middle of a pandemic. 
        </h2>

        <h2> I am sure some of us are worried about finding a job after graduation, since things are very uncertain right now. 
        </h2>
