    <h4> "I scream for quality and fantasy! But I understand if these straps of leather are not to everyone’s liking." </h4>
    <br> 
    <h4>"I don’t mind if people say I’m vulgar."</h4>

    <p> This iconic collection was very controversial. People either hated it! Or they loved it! Some people thought it made women seem like sex-objects, which was not Versace's intention at all!</p>
