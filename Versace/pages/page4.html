          Gianni Versace  founded the company in 1978. He was known as a fashion icon and rock star. After opening his Milan boutique in 1978, Versace quickly became a sensation in the international fashion scene. His designs were detailed with vivid colors, bold prints, and scandelous cuts. To the fashion industry, this was a refreshing contrast to the prevailing taste for muted colors and modest looks. He solidified his success with grandiose gestures and had a head in marketing. He was the first to realize the value of the celebrity in the front row, and the value of the supermodel, and put fashion on an international media platform said by Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour said in 1997. She also said, he relished media attention and masterminded it. And everybody followed in his footsteps.

             The assissination of Gianni Versace in 1997 shocked the whole world. Returning from a walk on Ocean Drive, Gianni was shot point-blank in front of his Miami mansion. The aftermath of this left the world in a frenzy.

   At the peak of success from his Atelier Versace 1997 Couture collection, Gianni s life was taken. Since the sudden death of Gianni at the hands of spree killer, Andrew Cunana,  all of the attention and responsibility had fallen on Donatella. Her front rows are now even more glittering than they were in her brothers day, and Hollywood is just as obsessed. Antonio Banderas has reportedly signed on to star as Gianni in a Bille August directed movie about the Italian fashion dynasty.
